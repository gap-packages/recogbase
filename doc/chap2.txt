  [33X[0;0YBy  default the [5Xrecogbase[105X package is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[105X when it
  is  installed.  You  must  load  the  package with [10XLoadPackage("recogbase");[110X
  before its functions become available.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsually,  this  package is only usable if you also install the [5Xrecog[105X package
  containing  all the implemented recognition methods. Since the [5Xrecog[105X package
  then  automatically  loads  the [5Xrecogbase[105X one only has to load both packages
  with [10XLoadPackage("recog");[110X.[133X
